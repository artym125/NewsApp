## Usage
Upon launching the News App, users will be presented with a news feed consisting of the latest articles. They can scroll through the feed to view article previews and tap on an article to open it in the Safari browser within the app.

Additionally, the app provides a filter option that allows users to narrow down the news feed based on six categories. Users can select a specific category, such as "Sports," "Entertainment," "Technology," "Business," "Health," or "Science," to view articles only related to that category.

The category filter enhances the user experience by providing a more personalized and focused news browsing experience. Users can easily switch between categories to explore articles that align with their interests and preferences.

To search for specific articles, users can enter keywords in the search bar. The app will retrieve relevant articles based on the search query.

For more refined searches, users can utilize the date filter option. By specifying a start and end date, the app will retrieve articles published within the specified range.

In the settings section, users can customize their preferences. They can enable or disable the display of article images in the news feed.

To share an interesting article, users can tap the share button located in the news feed. This will present sharing options to easily share the article with others.
